# Energy of Future
## About This Project

	In this project our main goal  is to provide information about energy and energy consumption to
    children who are our future. We know that it is important to be aware of energy consuming at an
    early age so we try to emphasize importance of consuming renewable energy sources at all.
    Thanks to this web app we hope that children who are our future will have well consciousness about
    energy consumption and renewable energy sources.
